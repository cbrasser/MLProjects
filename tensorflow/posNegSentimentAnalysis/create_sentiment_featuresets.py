lexicon = [chair, table, process, television]

Some random sentence to process

[0     0      0       0    1]

Our lexicon will be consisting out of every word in the entire dataset,
that way we can build an array of 0s & 1s like above to have uniform datapoints
and we dont need to worry about difference in sentence length etc.
